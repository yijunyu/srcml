  srcML is an XML application that adds information about syntactic
  structure to source code using XML tags.  Currently it is being
  used with C++ source code.
  
  Any compilable C++ program can be represented in srcML.  The dtd
  does not try to match the grammar of C++ but to contain it,
  i.e., all valid C++ programs can be represented in srcML, but not
  all valid srcML documents are valid C++ programs.
  
  srcML also stores all information in the source code file before
  the pre-processor is run.  This includes preprocessor directives,
  comments, macros, etc.
  
  srcML is a project of srcML, LLC.
